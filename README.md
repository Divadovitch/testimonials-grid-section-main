### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

To use a flexible grid for the layout on mobile with a `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));` and adapt its layout using a `grid-template-areas` with a media query. Use the `:nth-child()` pseudo-class to make the order of the cards count for the layout.

### Continued development

I would like to continue exploring the use of grids and their possibilities in flexible layouts.

### Useful resources

- [Autofit in CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/) - This helped me to make the CSS grid more flexible.
